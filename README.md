# ORSAT2

ORSAT2 was the first react.js project i tried to impliment...
In terms of functionality, the overall idea behind the production was a tool to simplify the collection and data collection for my coaching job.
It connected via USB-Serial connections with wiresharked hardware protocols to enable the transfer of data when activated.

Really this was a test for what i was able to do with web based software.
